## 💡 How Grid Trading Works

Grid trading is a strategy that places buy and sell orders at predetermined price intervals (the "grid"). When prices move up and down within this range:

- Buy orders are executed when price drops to a grid line
- Sell orders are executed when price rises to a grid line

This approach profits from market volatility without needing to predict market direction.
