## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Solana wallet with SOL for transactions and gas fees
- OpenAI API key for AI functionality

### Setup

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your:
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key
    - `RPC_URL` - Solana RPC endpoint
    - `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY` - Your wallet private key in base58 string format

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application

## üí° How Grid Trading Works

Grid trading is a strategy that places buy and sell orders at predetermined price intervals (the "grid"). When prices move up and down within this range:

- Buy orders are executed when price drops to a grid line
- Sell orders are executed when price rises to a grid line

This approach profits from market volatility without needing to predict market direction.


**Below shows a illustration of how the grid trading algorithm executes buy and sells:**

## üß† AI Integration

Our AI assistant helps you:
- Summarise trading performances and suggest modifications
- Recommend tokens to trade on based on semantic analysis
- Analyze market conditions and suggest optimal grid parameters
- Monitor performance and recommend adjustments
- Provide explanations about trading concepts
- Execute trades and manage your grid configurations

## üîÑ Trading Algorithm Deployment

GridBot AI's core trading engine operates independently as a cloud-based service, ensuring 24/7 reliable operation and real-time execution of trades according to your grid parameters.

### üñ•Ô∏è Trading Algorithm Repository

The grid trading algorithm that powers our platform is maintained in a separate repository and deployed as a cloud service:

üëâ [**GridAi Trading Algorithm Repository**](https://github.com/Kaiz404/GridAi-trading-algorithm)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Features

- **Automated Grid Trading**: Executes trades automatically when prices cross predefined grid levels
- **24/7 Continuous Operation**: Deployed on Google App Engine for uninterrupted trading
- **Jupiter DEX Integration**: Leverages Jupiter's API for optimal token swaps with best execution prices
- **Comprehensive Trade Tracking**: Records all transactions in MongoDB for analysis and audit
- **Customizable Grid Configurations**: Supports flexible grid setups with variable price ranges and densities
- **Multi-Token Support**: Works with a wide range of Solana-based tokens and trading pairs

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Our trading algorithm implements a sophisticated architecture to ensure reliability and performance:

1. **Core Trading Engine**:
   - Constantly monitors token prices across the Solana ecosystem
   - Evaluates price movements against configured grid levels
   - Triggers buy/sell operations when price crosses grid thresholds

2. **Database Integration**:
   - MongoDB backend stores all grid configurations and parameters
   - Records complete trade history with timestamps and execution details
   - Maintains state for analytics and reporting

3. **Jupiter API Integration**:
   - Sources real-time price data from multiple liquidity pools
   - Routes trades through optimal paths for best execution
   - Minimizes slippage and transaction costs

4. **Cloud Deployment**:
   - Hosted on Google App Engine for enterprise-grade reliability
   - Auto-scaling capabilities to handle peak trading volumes
   - Designed for minimal downtime with redundant systems

This decoupled architecture allows us to maintain a responsive frontend experience while ensuring trades are executed promptly and reliably, regardless of client-side connectivity.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- All trading operations happen on-chain with full transparency
- Your funds remain in your control at all times
- Private keys are never shared with third parties
